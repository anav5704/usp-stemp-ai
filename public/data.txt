Semester 1: Not offered                                                Semester 2: F at L

The course deals with cloud computing and its various services. Issues such as privacy, security and common standards and user accessibility in cloud computing will also be discussed. Cloud deployment models, shared computing resources like software, hardware infrastructure and platform to users on demand are included in this course.

CS230            Requirements Engineering                                        

Prerequisites: CS111 and (CS140 for BSE programme)

Semester 1: F at L                                                            Semester 2: Not offered

The course would introduce the various requirement elicitation techniques used in software engineering. The requirement identification, analysis, validation and prioritisation will also be discussed in the course. The students will prepare software requirement specification and perform initial software design in the course. Upon completion of the course student should be able to identify suitable requirement gathering techniques suitable for software projects.

CS241            Software Design & Implementation                       

Prerequisites: CS112 and CS230

Semester 1: Not offered                                                Semester 2: F at L

This course focuses on the design & implementation phases of the software development lifecycle. Basic concepts of design, testing, and enabling techniques will be reviewed. Approaches to ensuring quality in design will be emphasized as well as the need for systematic documentation. The implementation section will be covered during the laboratory sessions using a project based on an appropriate software development methodology. This will enable both large and smaller scale methodologies to be covered.
