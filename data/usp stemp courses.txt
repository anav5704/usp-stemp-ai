This course introduces concepts on smaller electricity generation systems connected to grid or simply distributed generation systems (DGS). The concept of DGS forms one of the components of the smart grids where electricity generation, storage and consumption are communicated to have better control of power production and flow. The decentralised “feed-in” system has its own technological challenges such as noise to signal ration (SNR) control, load flow control and safety issues. Economic issues such as feed-in tariffs also play a major role in development of DGS. This course explores technological developments and challenges faced in DGS and well as economical models are explored for scalability of such systems for profit making independent power producers (IPP). Core course for all Bachelor of Electrical and Electronics Engineering students.

Research methods is an essential component of study at the postgraduate level. This course introduces the concepts and principles of research and is a core course for all students studying at postgraduate level within the School. Research Methods is taught by an interdisciplinary team of academic staff drawn from the school. The course includes: what it means to be a postgraduate student; the development and application of the scientific method; USP research policy and ethics requirements; School research structure and research application procedures; School’s research groups; project planning, preparation and use of lab notebooks; using web of knowledge; critical review of research papers; how to write scientific papers, posters and present talks; subject-specific research methods. The course may be offered in second semester. All students registering in Postgraduate programmes are required, in their first semester of studies, to complete 14.5 hours of Information Research Skills conducted by the Library.
